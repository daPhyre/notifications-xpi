== Notifications, for Mozilla Firefox ==

Source code base to create notification extensions for Mozilla Firefox. This is based on https://github.com/daPhyre/notifications-crx , and though functiona, is still under development; won't be accepted yet on the Mozilla Add-on site as is.

In order to make your own extension from this base, and to avoid crashes with other extensions developed from it, you MUST replace the text "notifications" (lower-case) with the unique id of your own extension, from the next files:

- install.rdf
- chrome.manifest
- chrome/skin/toolbar-button.css
- chrome/content/overlay.xul
- chrome/content/script.js

To personalize for your own extension, you just have to modify from chrome/content/script.js lines 2 to 4, and modify or rewrite lines 23 to 44, this last depending on the page resources.

Enjoy making your notification extensions for Firefox :)
